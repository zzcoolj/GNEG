MANILA — President Duterte assured on Wednesday survivors of two destructive typhoons, which displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in Visayas and Mindanao, that they would no longer have to pay for their relocation houses.
Mr. Duterte made the surprise announcement to the victims of Typhoon “Pablo,” which devastated the Davao region in 2012, and Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” which flattened large swathes of Eastern Visayas a year later. The typhoon survivors attended the National Housing Summit organized by the National Housing Authority (NHA) in Quezon City.
